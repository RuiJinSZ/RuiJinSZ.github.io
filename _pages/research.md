## Constructing a realistic model including the cryptic sulfur cycle in Chesapeake Bay 

Previous biogeochemical models for Chesapeake Bay have a oversimplified representation of the impacts of sulfur cycling. In this project, we implemented a previously published biogeochemical code (BioRedoxCNPS) developed for open-ocean waters that includes “cryptic” microbial sulfur cycling within the ChesROMS physical model of the Chesapeake Bay.

However, translating the model to the Bay turns out not to be that straightforward. Model comparisons show that particle sinking velocities, burial, organic matter, nitrification and light attenuation all have significant impacts on simulation results. Further sensitivity study was done and we proposal a new baseline model for the Bay, which includes DOM-dependent absorption, a higher O2:N stoichiometry and easier nitrification. Our new model includes sulfur cycling and has comparable skill in predicting oxygen as ChesROMS_ECB, but also has improved simulation of nitrogen species compared with both original codes.

## Studying The role of Colored Dissolved Organic Matter (CDOM) in coastal ocean hypoxia

Representation of CDOM absorption in coastal environments remains rudimentary in models that nonetheless show skill in simulating these environments. This includes one of the leading models of the Chesapeake, which represent the impacts of CDOM in terms of a salinity-dependent absorption.
