I will join UW CICOES / PMEL as a postdoctoral researcher starting July 2024, mentored by Dr. Darren Pilcher, Dr. Brendan Carter and Dr. Kelly Kearney. Super exciting!

I got my Ph.D. at Johns Hopkins University,under the guidance of Professor AnandGnanadesikan. 

My primary research interest lies in the simulation of biogeochemical cycles in coastal regions through numerical modeling. Additionally, I am keen on exploring the potential of machine learning techniques to analyze observational data and outputs of ESMs to better understand the underlying drivers of these biogeochemical processes.
