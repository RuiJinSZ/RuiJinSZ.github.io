I am currently pursuing my Ph.D. at Johns Hopkins University, under the guidance of Professor Anand Gnanadesikan. 

My primary research interest lies in the simulation of biogeochemical cycles in coastal regions through numerical modeling. Additionally, I am keen on exploring the potential of machine learning techniques to analyze observational data and outputs of ESMs to better understand the underlying drivers of these biogeochemical processes.
